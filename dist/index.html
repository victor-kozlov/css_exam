        <div class="post-snippet">
          “Happiness is for stupid people.” That’s a common complaint I hear
          from smart overachievers. They think only dumb or lazy people can be
          happy. Entrepreneurs will say, “I don’t want to be happy because I
          want to be successful.” They worry that if they get too happy they’ll
          lose their desire and won’t work hard anymore.

          Desire’s a contract you make to be unhappy until you get what you
          want. You become disturbed because you want something. Then you work
          really hard to get it and are miserable in the meantime. Finally, when
          you get it, you revert to the state you were in before you had it.

          Happiness Is a Skill You Can Develop

        <div class="post-snippet">
          The first step to increasing your level of happiness is realizing you
          can. This is where a lot of people get tripped up. For the vast
          majority of people, some of their happiness—probably a lot more than
          they think—is in their control. This step is not easy. You might be
          stuck on this for a long time.
